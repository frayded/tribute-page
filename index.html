                In the town of Koto Gadang, a suburb of Fort de Kock, on October 8, 1884, Agus Salim was born as Masjhoedoelhaq Salim. Salim went to Europeesche Lagere School for elementary school, which was unusual for a child from a non-European background back in the 1960s and 1970s. He went on to finish education at Batavia's Hogere Burgerschool, where he earned the best grade in all of the Dutch East Indies. <br> <br>

                After he was done with his employment in Jeddah as an interpreter for the Indies hajj from 1905 through 1911, he returned and began a career in journalism, publishing works for magazine and publications like Hindia Baroe, Fadjar Asia, and Moestika. Later in life, he became an editor for the Sarekat Islam periodical Neratja, of which he was a prominent contributor. He returned to Java after three years, during which time he established a private Hollandsche Indische School in his hometown of Koto Gadang. <br><br>

                Since his appointment in March 1946 as Deputy Foreign Minister under Foreign Minister and Prime Minister Sutan Sjahrir, Salim has presided over a wide variety of diplomatic missions on behalf of Indonesia. In March and April 1947, he represented Indonesia in the Asian Relations Conference in New Delhi. In that same month, he headed a small delegation to Arab countries in search of diplomatic recognition. The other members of the delegation were Abdurrahman Baswedan, Rasjidi, and Nazir Sutan Pamuncak. Meeting with Egyptian Prime Minister Mahmoud El Nokrashy Pasha and Arab League Secretary-General Abdul Rahman Hassan Azzam, Salim demonstrated his command of traditional (Fusha) Arabic. Over the course of the next three months, Salim and his delegation were able to get diplomatic recognition from the majority of League members. <br><br>

                Together with Sjahrir, Salim went to the United States in August 1947 for a session of the United Nations Security Council held in Lake Success, New York. Together with financier Margono Djojohadikusumo, they flew a cargo of illegal vanilla to Singapore in 1942, breaking a Dutch naval blockade. After returning home, Salim participated in the Indonesian delegation's deliberations onboard the USS Renville, which resulted in a deal that briefly defused tensions following the collapse of the prior Linggadjati Agreement. Salim's connection with the Dutch chief negotiator Abdulkadir Widjojoatmodjo (a KNIL high-ranking officer with whom he had served in the Dutch consulate in Jeddah) made for a more amicable negotiation process. <br><br>

                When the first Hatta Cabinet was formed, Salim continued to oversee foreign policy serving in ad interim capacity. When the Dutch launched their military onslaught, Operatie Kraai, in December 1948, he was among the Republican leaders forced to flee Yogyakarta, the country's capital. Salim was initially sent to Berastagi in North Sumatra with Sjahrir and Sukarno before being relocated to Parapat. Upon returning to Yogya with the other leaders, Salim resumed his position as foreign minister in the second Hatta Cabinet from December 1948 to July 1949. <br><br>

                Salim's last diplomatic assignment was in late 1949, when he was member of the Indonesian delegation to the Dutch-Indonesian Round Table Conference in The Hague. A new government, the United States of Indonesia, was established after Hatta's second cabinet was sacked in December 1949. Hatta, the first and only foreign minister and prime minister of the United States of Indonesia, hired Salim as his foreign policy advisor. In September of 1950, the United States of Indonesia as a political entity was formally disbanded. <br><br>

                Salim died on November 4, 1954, in Jakarta and was buried at the Taman Makam Pahlawan Kalibata.
